# Time-Machine--Temporal Catastrophe

# Temporal Catastrophe 🕰️😸

A hilariously useless **time travel web app** where your dreams of going back to the past or rushing to the future collide with reality… and a waving robot cat.  

Built for **Code At Christmas 2025** — a hackathon where weird, funny, and cozy projects win hearts.

- 🕒 **Travel to Past or Future** – input your desired time and embark on a chaotic journey.  
- 🎵 **Chalooo Sound** – iconic meme sound plays during travel.  
- 😂 **Funny Destination Moments** – elaborated based on your input:

- 🔊 **Mute/Unmute Toggle** – control travel and funny sounds independently.  
- 🌟 **Dynamic Animations** – parallax backgrounds, particle effects, smooth motion.
